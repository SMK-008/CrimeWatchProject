## Architecture

The application follows Clean Architecture principles with MVVM pattern:

```
app/
├── data/           # Data layer with repositories and data sources
│   ├── models/     # Data models and DTOs
│   └── remote/     # Remote data sources (Firebase)
├── domain/         # Business logic and use cases
│   ├── models/     # Domain models
│   └── usecases/   # Business logic implementations
├── presentation/   # UI layer with ViewModels and Compose UI
│   ├── screens/    # Composable screens
│   ├── components/ # Reusable UI components
│   └── viewmodels/ # Screen ViewModels
└── di/             # Dependency injection modules
```
